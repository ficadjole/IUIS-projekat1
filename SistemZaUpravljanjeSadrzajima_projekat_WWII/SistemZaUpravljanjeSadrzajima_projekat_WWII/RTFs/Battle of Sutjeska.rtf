{\fs24\f3 {\ltrch German forces managed to encircle the Main Operational Group of the Yugoslav People's Army in the difficult mountainous terrain of Durmitor and impose on them prolonged, exhausting battles, contrary to the tactics of partisan warfare and, given the balance of power, extremely unfavorable for the Yugoslav People's Army. The Partisans found themselves confined in a small area, constantly battered by artillery and air forces, suffering enormous losses, and without a source of food. By 31 May, seven brigades had been assembled in the area between the Piva and Sutjeska rivers. On 5 and 7 June, the first attempts to break through the enemy front in the lower reaches of the Sutjeska failed. The breakthrough across the swollen Sutjeska River, in its middle course, near Tjenti\'9ate, was carried out by the 1st Proletarian Division.}\li0\ri0\sa160\sb0\fi0\qj\par}
